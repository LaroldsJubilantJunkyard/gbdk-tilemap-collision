# GBDK Tilemap Collision

![GBDK Tilemap Collision](/res/TilmapCollision.png "Tilemap Collision")

This repo contains the source code for the my Tilemap Collision tutorial.

You can find a written version [here](https://laroldsjubilantjunkyard.com/tutorial/tilemap-collision-detection-in-game-boy-games/).

Obviously, this tutorial is built using [GBDK-2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020), be sure to download it and become familiar with it beforehand.

This rep compiles two files: TilemapCollision.gb, and TilemapCollision_SinglePoint.gb. The former does tilemap collision against a 16x16 square, the latter does tilemap collision against a single point. For the 16x16 square, more collision detection tests are needed to handle the players size.
